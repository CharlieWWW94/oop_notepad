# oop_notepad
A quick and easy OOP notepad for storing short, sticky-note style messages.
Each of the .py files are required for the running of the notepad.
Use the TUI.py file as your executable, as this contains the class/object that ties the notes, notepad and pickle files together.

The requirements.txt is empty as this little projects is based only on python core libraries.

Enjoy!
